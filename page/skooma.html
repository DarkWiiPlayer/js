	<h2>Introduction & Scope</h2>
	<p>
		Skooma.js is a library for generating DOM nodes within JavaScript.
	</p>

	<h3>What are the benefits of Skooma?</h3>
	<p>
		Skooma is only a small ES6 module that uses meta-programming to
		turn JavaScript into a <span title="Domain-Specific Language">DSL</span>
		that generates HTML and XML subtrees.
		<br>
		This means you're writing plain JavaScript code that needs no additional
		transpilation steps and runs directly in the browser.
